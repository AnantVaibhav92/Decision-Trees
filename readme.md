# Decision Trees
This is a project in python aimed to create the decision tree from scratch using ID3 algorithm

Here we use the information gain to recursively figure out the best feature to split on. 

Copy or unzip the data folder (initially provided with the assignment) in the same directory. Please note - the path for reading the data file is provided as, e.g. : "/data/monks-1.train". Therefore we need the whole data directory in the same place as the Decision_trees.py file.

**Files**: Decision_trees.ipynb
**Folders**: Data



# Dependencies:

Kindly install and import the below libraries before running the Decision_trees.py file:
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
